      "I heard about my new job on H-Net" has been a familiar expression for over twenty years since H-Net began distributing position announcements to its 
      global audience of 180,000 scholars, teachers, and administrators at academic and nonprofit institutions.

      <br></br>
      <br></br>

      The Job Guide is the premier source of information about academic job postings in the US and abroad. 
      Increasingly, the Job Guide serves the non-academic world of non-profits, government, and NGOs, 
      as well as for-profit companies seeking high quality candidates with specialized training and experience. T
      he active community of researchers, teachers, and scholarly professionals already collaborating through H-Net's 180+ 
      public networks is a highly motivated, self-selecting audience with established networks within and outside of the academy. 
      The Job Guide is a simple, effective way for employers to connect with H-Netâ€™s audience to find the right candidate for the job. 
      Revenue from the H-Net Job Guide recovers the cost of all H-Net's services to the public while it supports the work of hundreds of volunteer editors.

      <br></br>
      <br></br>

      All Job Guide announcements are freely, publicly available.
      
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
